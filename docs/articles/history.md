Modern-day pizza can trace its origins back to Italy somewhere in the 18<sup>th</sup> or 19<sup>th</sup> century. Naples is famously the home of the *Pizza Margherita*. The style that is in many ways the father of modern-day thin crust pizza. Margherita is a simple pizza. A yeasted dough is streched it into a circle while leaving an airy ring around the edges that will form up into a crust during the baking processs. On top fresh crushed tomates, fresh mozarella cheese, basil leaves, and olive oil complete the pizza. Once it is formed it is cooked at high temperatures for a short period of time before being cut up and served.

From that first Marghertia pizza the food has expanded and morphed across time and geography. In the United States the thin crust pizza become a popular staple in Italian restrurants around New York City. Thicker pan style pizzas found a home in Detroit. And the intriguing deep-dish style become synonmous with Chicago pizza.
